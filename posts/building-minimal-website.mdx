hi! in this post, i'll share my experience building a minimal personal website using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

this project started with a simple goal: create a clean, fast-loading platform for sharing my thoughts and work.

## key decisions

the tech stack was chosen for:

- simplicity in development
- excellent developer experience
- great performance out of the box

## what i learned

building this site taught me the value of minimalism in both design and code.
